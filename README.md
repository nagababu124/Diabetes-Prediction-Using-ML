## overview
In this project, the objective is to predict whether the person has Diabetes or not based on various features such as
* Pregnancies
* Glucose
* BloodPressure
* SkinThickness
* DiabetesPedigreeFunction
* Insulin Level
* Age
* BMI 

The data set that has used in this project has taken from the kaggle. 
"This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. 
The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, 
based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these 
instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage." and used StandardScaler and SVM.

## Learning Objective
The following points were the objective of the project . 
If you are looking for all the following points in this repo then i have not covered all in this repo. 
I'm working on blog about this mini project and I'll update the link of blog about all the points in details later . 
(The main intention was to create an end-to-end ML project.)

* Data gathering
* Descriptive Analysis
* Data Preprocessing
* Data Modelling
* Model Evaluation

## Technologies
* pandas
